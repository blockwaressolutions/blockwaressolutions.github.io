<p>The explosive growth of the cryptocurrency market has converted Mike Novogratz, a former manager at Fortress, the $72 billion money manager, into a bitcoin evangelist.</p>
<p>And now he&#8217;s reportedly raising $500 million for a new cryptocurrency hedge fund, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-26/mike-novogratz-is-set-for-comeback-with-crytocurrency-hedge-fund">Bloomberg News</a>.</p>
<p>The new fund would represent a sort of come back for Novogratz, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-wall-street-saying-about-novogratz-2015-10">who left Fortress in 2015 after the $2.3 billion fund he managed failed to deliver returns for its investors</a>.</p>
<p>Novogratz declined to comment about the crypto-fund during an interview with Bloomberg TV, but a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg Novogratz will put up $150 million of his own money and seek out additional cash from &#8220;family offices, wealthy individuals and fellow hedge fund managers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, Novogratz did admit to Bloomberg that there are plenty of opportunities to make money in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>“This is going to be the largest bubble of our lifetimes,” Novogratz said to Bloomberg. “Prices are going to get way ahead of where they should be. You can make a whole lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it.”</p>
<p>Already, the billionaire actively trades bitcoin himself.</p>
<p>“I sold at $5,000 or $4,980,” he told Bloomberg. “Then three weeks later I’m trying to buy it in the low $3,000s. If you’re good at that and you’re a trading junkie, it’s a lot of fun.”</p>
<p>The so-called Galaxy Digital Asset Fund would be the largest cryptocurrency fund, according to Bloomberg. But it would not be the first. Autonomous NEXT, a financial technology analytics firm, has been keeping track of all the crypto-funds out there and at last count there are at least 75 in existence.</p>
<p>Lex Sokolin, a partner at Autonomous NEXT, told Business Insider the firm estimates total assets managed by such firms to stand somewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like wild mushrooms, crypto-hedge funds have been taking root in the volatile and unregulated soil of the crypto economy,&#8221; Autonomous NEXT said in a post on their <a href="https://next.autonomous.com/thoughts/how-many-crypto-hedge-funds-can-you-count">website.</a></p>
<p>Many of the firms sport crypto-themed names such as Ether Capital, an homage to the token powering the ethereum blockchain, and Medici Crypto.</p>
<p>The meteoric rise of digital currencies such as bitcoin, which is up nearly 570% since 2016, and <a href="http://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/eth-usd">ether</a>, which is up 2,100% over the same period, has drawn the attention of Wall Street. On top of this, the market for initial coin offerings, a fundraising method based on blockchain technology, is exploding with over $2 billion raised via ICOs since the beginning of the year, according to Autonomous NEXT.</p>
<p>Even traditional hedge funders are paying attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen managers invest in the actual currencies and/or in the ICOs, and soon there will be derivatives as well,” Steve Nadel, a hedge fund attorney, and partner at Seward &amp; Kissel, said in an email sent to Business Insider.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cryptocurrencies have garnered a fair amount of interest in the investment management space, primarily because of the returns they have recently shown,&#8221; he said.</p>
