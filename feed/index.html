<div class="group">
<p><a class="inline_quotes" href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMD" data-gdsid="9238" data-inline-quote-symbol="AMD">AMD</a> and <a class="inline_quotes" href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=NVDA" data-gdsid="27095" data-inline-quote-symbol="NVDA">Nvidia</a> will suffer as specialized digital currency mining chips hit the market this year, according to a Wall Street firm.</p>
<p>Susquehanna reduced its rating to negative from neutral and lowered its price target for AMD shares, citing impending competition from cryptocurrency mining company Bitmain.</p>
<p>&#8220;During our travels through Asia last week, we confirmed that Bitmain has already developed an ASIC [application-specific integrated circuit] for mining Ethereum, and is readying the supply chain for shipments in 2Q18,&#8221; analyst Christopher Rolland wrote in a note to clients Monday. &#8220;While Bitmain is likely to be the largest ASIC vendor (currently 70-80% of Bitcoin mining ASICs) and the first to market with this product, we have learned of at least three other companies working on Ethereum ASICs, all at various stages of development.&#8221;</p>
<div id="inline_movable_ad"></div>
<p>Cryptocurrency miners use graphics cards based on AMD&#8217;s and Nvidia&#8217;s chips to &#8220;mine&#8221; new coins, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation. Digital currency ethereum is up more than 800 percent over the past 12 months, according to Coinbase data.</p>
<p>Bitmain dominates the &#8220;bitcoin&#8221; industry with its specialized ASIC chips that are more efficient at mining than graphic chips from AMD and Nvidia. Bernstein has said <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/23/secretive-chinese-bitcoin-mining-company-may-have-made-as-much-money-as-nvidia-last-year.html">Bitmain likely made as much as Nvidia</a> did last year. Analysts estimate that most of Bitmain&#8217;s revenue is generated by selling mining rigs powered by the company&#8217;s chips.</p>
<p>Rolland believes Bitmain&#8217;s specialized chip offering for ethereum will hurt demand for PC graphics cards. He estimated ethereum mining-related sales accounted for about 20 percent of AMD&#8217;s sales and 10 percent of Nvidia&#8217;s revenue.</p>
<p>As a result the analyst lowered his price target for AMD shares to $7.50 from $13, representing 29 percent downside from Friday&#8217;s close.</p>
<p>He also reduced his forecast for Nvidia shares to $200 from $215, but did not downgrade the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nvidia has a stronger and more durable gaming franchise which would help it work through this potential Ethereum-related unwind,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>The analyst reiterated his neutral rating for Nvidia shares.</p>
<p>Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment. AMD sent this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A report was published on AMD which hypothesized very high revenue for Ethereum-related GPU sales. As a reminder, on our Q4&#8217;17 earnings conference call we stated that the percentage of annual revenue related to Blockchain was approximately mid-single digit percentage in 2017. We had significant growth in the GPU business outside of Blockchain in Q4&#8217;17 as we ramped our Radeon Vega products, our GPU compute products, and our Apple business. We also spoke about strength across the rest of our business with AMD Ryzen and AMD EPYC product momentum. We have very compelling long-term drivers for the company including PCs, servers and graphics and our Q1 2018 financial guidance reflects that.</p>
<p>We appreciate the time and attention that investors continue to pay to Blockchain and cryptocurrency, but would also like to keep it in perspective with the multiple other growth opportunities ahead for AMD.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>AMD shares declined 1.79 percent Monday, while Nvidia&#8217;s stock rose 4.94 percent.</p>

<p><strong>136 Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) were installed during the market pullback alone</strong>, bringing the worldwide total to 2177 as tracked by <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/">CoinATMRadar.com</a>. On average, 5 BTM locations spring up every day. This is just one more example of how the crypto ecosystem continues to grow, despite depressing market sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>The United States still dominates the BTM industry with 1296 locations nationwide.</strong> This is a marked 30% increase since we last covered this <a href="https://cryptoanswers.net/bitcoin-atm-us-1000/">development</a> in October 2017.

<p><em>Top 5 countries: USA, Canada, UK, Austria, Spain</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin ATMs Expand Access to Top Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>BTMs are beginning to pop up everywhere. Las Angeles alone boasts 165 units, and New York has 127. They offer quick, easy access to anyone needing to acquire and use Bitcoin on the fly. Transactions are instant, but this convenience comes at a price. Buying Bitcoin incurs a ~9% fee, while selling fetches a 7% fee.</p>
<p>In addition to Bitcoin, many locations offer Litecoin (905), Ether (332), and DASH (173) as well. Of the 2177 total BTMs, 944 of them offer some sort of altcoin support, and some of them even offer Dogecoin and/or Monero.</p>
<h2>Privacy Issues</h2>
<p>Until recently, fiat could be converted to crypto with nothing more than cash in your pocket. Personal details were unnecessary, and transactions could be made anonymously. This was great for innocent users to take advantage of, but it also allowed black market operatives easy access. Most BTM manufacturers are beginning to incorporate identification features now to comply with increasing regulation. Operators may opt to disable those features but are often mandated to use them. Some locations are still able to be used anonymously, but generally a phone number is required. <strong>BTMs remain the go-to resource for private transactions, however. Exchanges maintain an arsenal of client data, while BTMs do not. They help distance users from centralized banks and exchanges and keep private details safe. </strong>Anyone off-put by the phone number requirement can sidestep using a burn phone.</p>
<h2>Final Word</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to find out how much Bitcoin is traded through these avenues compared to LTC, ETH or other offerings. That would be interesting info, as it would represent how raw use cases of top cryptocurrencies are evolving as their networks compete. As BTC network fees escalate out of control, I would imagine ETH and LTC are gaining on BTC in this respect.</p>
<p><strong>At any rate, the confidence in the BTM market tells a different story than the exchange market. </strong>While currencies are subject to FUD and manipulation, ecosystem figures are immune.<strong> The best way to gauge the health of crypto in general is to look at real usage, adoption, and infrastructure growth. </strong>Fortunately for us all, that continues to be very much a growth story.</p>

<p>At least one of Wall Street’s biggest firms is growing more comfortable with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><a title="Company Overview" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US" rel="nofollow noopener">Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</a> is setting up a trading desk to make markets in digital currencies such as bitcoin, according to people with knowledge of the strategy. The bank aims to get the business running by the end of June, if not earlier, two of the people said. Another said it’s still trying to work out security issues as well as how it would hold, or custody, the assets.</p>
<p>The move positions Goldman Sachs to become the first large Wall Street firm to make markets in cryptocurrencies, whose wild price swings and surging values have captured the public’s imagination but given pause to established institutions. Already, the bank is among just a few mainstream firms clearing a new breed of bitcoin futures offered by Cboe Global Markets Inc. and CME Group Inc. Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp., for example, have been taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is now assembling a team in New York, one of the people said. While the bank hasn’t made a decision where to house the desk, one possibility is that it will operate within the fixed-income, currencies and commodities unit’s systematic trading function, which conducts transactions electronically, two people said. Darren Cohen, in the firm’s principal strategic investments group, is also looking at opportunities, another person said.</p>
<div class="regwall" data-position="4"></div>
<p>“In response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them,” Michael DuVally, a spokesman, said in a statement.</p>

<p>Publicly, Chief Executive Officer <a title="Billionaire Profile" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/2378577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lloyd Blankfein</a> has been circumspect. He <a class="terminal-news-story" title="Lloyd Blankfein: Still thinking about #Bitcoin. No conclusion - not endorsing/rejecting. Know that folks also were skeptical" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/OX9EG1AIBMDC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> in October that his firm was looking at how to deal with bitcoin. In a Bloomberg Television interview last month, he <a title="Blankfein Says Too Soon for Bitcoin Plan as Volatility Jumps (1)" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-30/blankfein-says-too-soon-for-bitcoin-strategy-as-volatility-jumps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> his bank didn’t need a bitcoin strategy yet because the digital currency is still just developing and volatile.</p>
<p>And when the bank began clearing futures earlier this month, it demanded that some clients set aside funds equal to the full value of their trade, people familiar with the policy <a title="Goldman Said to Demand 100% Margin on Some Bitcoin Futures (1)" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/goldman-said-to-seek-100-margin-on-some-bitcoin-futures-trades" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> at the time. The conservatism deterred some customers and led them to take their business elsewhere.</p>

<div class="group">
<p>CME CEO and Chairman Terry Duffy may not own bitcoin, but he thinks it could change the world. That&#8217;s why <a class="inline_quotes" href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CME" data-gdsid="13509" data-inline-quote-symbol="CME">CME Group</a> is launching bitcoin futures Sunday – with some extra regulatory safeguards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regulation is important to any product – when you look at cryptocurrencies or anything else you trade &#8212; so we continue to evolve,&#8221; Duffy said on CNBC&#8217;s Fast Money.&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="inline_asset" title="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/10/bitcoin-futures-set-to-trade-on-cboe-sunday-evening.html" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/10/bitcoin-futures-set-to-trade-on-cboe-sunday-evening.html">Competitor Cboe, which launched bitcoin futures Dec. 10</a>, will offer contracts as low as 1 bitcoin. But CME is only offering contracts on 5 bitcoins, in part to ward off retail participants.</p>
<div id="inline_movable_ad"></div>
<p>&#8220;The last thing I want to have happen is for participants that have never traded futures contracts before to enter into CME&#8217;s markets and begin trading bitcoin futures,&#8221; Duffy said. &#8220;We&#8217;re targeting the more professional type trader and the institutional investor.&#8221;</p>
<p>To determine pricing, CME will tie futures to a bitcoin reference rate, which is an average of four exchanges.</p>
<p>To offset bitcoin&#8217;s notorious volatility, CME has already raised initial margins – or the amount put up at the start of the trade – to 47 percent from 35 percent, and set maintenance margins at 43 percent. Duffy said CME has no qualms about raising the rate again.</p>
<p>&#8220;If, in fact, this thing starts to move precipitously, our margins will increase, our velocity logic will kick in and other functions we have, as well,&#8221; Duffy said.</p>
<p>Duffy doesn&#8217;t own bitcoin personally, but he believes the cryptocurrency may well change the future of finance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re going through a major change in finance,&#8221; Duffy said. &#8220;For us not to list it and to miss potentially helping something that could change the world would be wrong, too. I think we&#8217;re taking a very measured approach.&#8221;</p>

<p>The explosive growth of the cryptocurrency market has converted Mike Novogratz, a former manager at Fortress, the $72 billion money manager, into a bitcoin evangelist.</p>
<p>And now he&#8217;s reportedly raising $500 million for a new cryptocurrency hedge fund, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-26/mike-novogratz-is-set-for-comeback-with-crytocurrency-hedge-fund">Bloomberg News</a>.</p>
<p>The new fund would represent a sort of come back for Novogratz, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-wall-street-saying-about-novogratz-2015-10">who left Fortress in 2015 after the $2.3 billion fund he managed failed to deliver returns for its investors</a>.</p>
<p>Novogratz declined to comment about the crypto-fund during an interview with Bloomberg TV, but a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg Novogratz will put up $150 million of his own money and seek out additional cash from &#8220;family offices, wealthy individuals and fellow hedge fund managers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, Novogratz did admit to Bloomberg that there are plenty of opportunities to make money in the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>“This is going to be the largest bubble of our lifetimes,” Novogratz said to Bloomberg. “Prices are going to get way ahead of where they should be. You can make a whole lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it.”</p>
<p>Already, the billionaire actively trades bitcoin himself.</p>
<p>“I sold at $5,000 or $4,980,” he told Bloomberg. “Then three weeks later I’m trying to buy it in the low $3,000s. If you’re good at that and you’re a trading junkie, it’s a lot of fun.”</p>
<p>The so-called Galaxy Digital Asset Fund would be the largest cryptocurrency fund, according to Bloomberg. But it would not be the first. Autonomous NEXT, a financial technology analytics firm, has been keeping track of all the crypto-funds out there and at last count there are at least 75 in existence.</p>
<p>Lex Sokolin, a partner at Autonomous NEXT, told Business Insider the firm estimates total assets managed by such firms to stand somewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like wild mushrooms, crypto-hedge funds have been taking root in the volatile and unregulated soil of the crypto economy,&#8221; Autonomous NEXT said in a post on their <a href="https://next.autonomous.com/thoughts/how-many-crypto-hedge-funds-can-you-count">website.</a></p>
<p>Many of the firms sport crypto-themed names such as Ether Capital, an homage to the token powering the ethereum blockchain, and Medici Crypto.</p>
<p>The meteoric rise of digital currencies such as bitcoin, which is up nearly 570% since 2016, and <a href="http://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/eth-usd">ether</a>, which is up 2,100% over the same period, has drawn the attention of Wall Street. On top of this, the market for initial coin offerings, a fundraising method based on blockchain technology, is exploding with over $2 billion raised via ICOs since the beginning of the year, according to Autonomous NEXT.</p>
<p>Even traditional hedge funders are paying attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen managers invest in the actual currencies and/or in the ICOs, and soon there will be derivatives as well,” Steve Nadel, a hedge fund attorney, and partner at Seward &amp; Kissel, said in an email sent to Business Insider.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cryptocurrencies have garnered a fair amount of interest in the investment management space, primarily because of the returns they have recently shown,&#8221; he said.</p>
